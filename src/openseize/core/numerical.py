            number by factors of 2 may increase the speed of this algorithm.
            Defaults to 32 (see Implementation Notes)

    Numpy & Scipy implementations of oaconvolve require that the input be an
    in-memory array. Openseize utilizes a producer making it suitable for
    convolving 1-D arrays across data that may not fit into memory.

    Implementation Notes:
    The overlap-add convolve method processes small segments O(len(window)).
    The producer then may have to perform many small reads if its
    data source is a file. To avoid this, oaconvolve uses the FIFOArray
    queue as a cache to hold larger arrays of the data. These larger cached
    arrays are then iterated over in chunks of the small segments. This
    complicates the code's structure but gives a large performance boost.

    The additional nfft_factor effectively increases the amount of samples
    that the algorithm will convolve at once. By increasing the nffts above
    the optimal value for the FFT algorithm, we allow oaconvolve to convolve
    more data at a single time which reduces the data fetches. This improves
    performance up until the processors cache size is reached. The value
    should be decreased if the window is large and increased if the window
    is small to improve performance.

    Returns: A generator of convolved ndarrays.

        Scipy allows for the segment length and number of DFT points (nfft)

        the segment is less than nfft. Openseize welch follows the same

        fs: int

            with the next data segment. In order for the STFT to be
            invertible. The overlap amount needs to equally weight all

            constraint. It is window dependent. If you intend to invert this
            STFT (synthesis) you  will need to verify this constraint is met

        scaling: str either 'spectrum' or 'density'
            Determines the normalization to apply to the estimate for each
            segment. If 'spectrum', then np.abs(X)**2 is the magnitude
            spectrum for each segment. If density np.abs(X)**2 is the
            density spectrum and may be integrated over to give the total
            power for a segment.
        boundary: bool
            A boolean indicating if the first and last segments should be

            at nfft//2.  This allows for inversion of the first/last input
            points for windows whose first & last values are 0. Unlike
            scipy, openseize only allows for zero extensions since this has
            the clear interpretation of a zero-pad interpolation of the
            frequencies in the DFT.
        padded: bool
            Specifies if the last array of the producer should be padded
            with zeros so that a whole number of overlapped nfft segments
            fit into the signal length. This enables inversion of the stft
            since the entire signal is used. This is in contrast with Welch
            which drops the last segment if shorter than nfft - noverlap.

    Returns:
