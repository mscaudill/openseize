"""A collection of callable Finite Impulse Response filters.

This module contains three distint types of FIR Filters.

## General Cosine window (GCW) FIRs
A filter design that allows for the specification of pass and stop bands but
*not* attenuations. The amplitude response of the filter is determined by
the window shape alone. The following table list the GCWs available:

    - Rectangular
    - Bartlett
    - Hann
    - Hamming
    - Blackman

## Kaiser Parameterized window FIR
A filter design with an additional parameter that specifies the window
shape.  These filters can be designed to meet to the strictest criteria in
the pass and stop bands. **This filter design is the recommended FIR type in
Openseize.**

## Remez (Parks-McClellan) Optimal FIRs
A filter design that minimizes the difference between the amplitude response
of a approximating Chebyshev filter from the desired amplitude response
using the Chebyshev approximation. This filter is optimal in the sense that
it yields the lowest number of coeffecients at the cost of instability. It
supports multiple pass and stop bands.

Examples:

    >>> # Design a lowpass Kaiser FIR with a passband edge at 500 Hz and
    ... # transition width of 100 Hz. It should have no more than 0.5 dB
    ... # ripple in the pass band and reach 40 dB attenuation in the stop
    ... # band
    >>> kaiser = Kaiser(fpass=500, fstop=600, fs=5000, gpass=0.5, gstop=40)
    >>> # print the filter to see its attributes
    >>> print(kaiser)
    >>> # plot the filter to see its design
    >>> kaiser.plot()
    >>> # apply the filter to a producer of ndarrays
    >>> result = kaiser(pro, chunksize=10000, axis=-1, mode='same')

            - numtaps (int):
                The number of taps used to construct this filter. This
                overrides Remez's internal numtaps property.
            - weight (Sequence):
                A sequence the same length as desired with weights to
                relatively weight each band. If no value is passed
                the weights are the inverse of the percentage loss and
                attenuation in the pass and stop bands respectively.
            - maxiter (int):
                The number of iterations to test for convergence.
            - grid_density (int):
                Resolution of the grid remez uses to minimize E(f). If
                algorithm converges but has unexpected ripple, increasing
                this value can help. The default is 16.

    Examples:
        >>> # Design a bandpass filter that passes 400 to 800 Hz
        >>> bands = [0, 300, 400, 800, 900, 2500]
        >>> desired = [0, 1, 0]
        >>> filt = Remez(bands, desired, fs=5000, gpass=.5, gstop=40)
        >>> filt.plot()

    Notes:
        The Remez algorithm may fail to converge. It is recommended that any
        filter designed with Remez be visually inspected before use.
